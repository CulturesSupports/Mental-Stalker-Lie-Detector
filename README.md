# Mental-Stalker-Lie-Detector
Lie Detector For Mental Torture Stalkers



Creating a node.js application to find mental illness causes in person with criminal Lie detectors involves several steps. Below is a basic outline of how you can implement this using Node.js and Express. This example assumes you have a database to store mental health information and a set of rules for identifying potential causes.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js官网](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Express**: Install Express using npm. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

3. **MongoDB**: Ensure you have MongoDB installed. You can download it from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download). Install it using:
   ```bash
   npm install -g mongodb
   ```

### Database Setup

1. **MongoDB**: Set up a MongoDB database named `mentalillnesscauses`.

2. **Schema**: Create a schema for the mental health information. For example, a simple schema might look like:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const mongooseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
     name: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     },
     cause: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     },
     diagnosis: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Connect to MongoDB**: Set up a connection to your MongoDB database. Ensure you have a connection string in your `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mentalillnesscauses
   ```

4. **Create Models**: Define your models using Mongoose. For example:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const mongooseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
     name: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     },
     cause: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     },
     diagnosis: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     }
   });

   module.exports = mongoose.model('MentalHealth', mongooseSchema);
   ```

5. **Initialize MongoDB**: Set up a connection to your MongoDB database using Mongoose. This is usually done in your app file:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const mongooseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
     name: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     },
     cause: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     },
     diagnosis: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     }
   });

   mongoose.set('useUnifiedTopology', true);
   mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true
   });
   ```

### Application Logic

1. **Define Routes**: Create routes to handle user interactions. For example:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const mentalHealthModel = require('./models/MentalHealth');

   app.get('/mental-illness-causes', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const mentalHealths = await mentalHealthModel.find();
       res.json(mentalHealths);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching mental health:', error);
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch mental health' });
     }
   });

   app.post('/mental-illness-causes', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const mentalHealth = new mentalHealthModel(req.body);
       await mentalHealthModel.save();
       res.status(201).json(mentalHealth);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error saving mental health:', error);
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to save mental health' });
     }
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Connect to MongoDB**: Ensure your MongoDB database is running and accessible from your machine.

2. **Start the Server**: Run your Node.js application:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

3. **Test the Application**: You can test the application using a tool like Postman or curl to send requests to the endpoints.

### Explanation

- **Database**: The application uses Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database. You need to set up an Express server and connect to your MongoDB server.
  
- **Routes**: The application defines two routes:
  - `/mental-illness-causes`: Returns a list of mental health cases.
  - `/mental-illness-causes`: Saves a new mental health case to the database.

- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is used to define the structure of the mental health data. It's crucial to use `mongoose.Schema` to define the fields and validations for your models.

- **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling to manage exceptions and return appropriate responses.

This is a basic implementation. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to expand and enhance the application.

To develop a mental polygraph dataset that enables them to read USB data into an application and trigger device reading from an audio source using Python, you would need to follow these steps:

1. **Load the Dataset**: You can use libraries such as `pandas` to load your dataset.

2. **Extract Features**: Use libraries such as `scikit-learn` to extract features from the video or image.

3. **Model Architecture**: Choose a suitable model architecture for your application, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a pre-trained model from a knowledge base.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the model's performance.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Here's an example of how you might use Scikit-learn to build a mental polygraph dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('mental_polygraph_dataset.csv')

# Extract features
X = data.drop('label', axis=1)
y = data['label']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Random Forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Save the predictions to a file
np.savetxt('mental_polygraph_predictions.csv', y_pred, delimiter=',')

# Load the predictions from a file
loaded_predictions = np.loadtxt('mental_polygraph_predictions.csv')

print(y_pred)
```

This is a basic example and may not be suitable for real-world applications. For a more robust and accurate mental polygraph dataset, you would need to use a more advanced approach, such as:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Use pre-trained models or feature extraction techniques to extract features from the video or image.
2. **Model Architecture**: Choose a suitable model architecture for your application, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a pre-trained model from a knowledge base.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the model's performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Remember to replace `'mental_polygraph_dataset.csv'` with the actual file name that contains your dataset.
